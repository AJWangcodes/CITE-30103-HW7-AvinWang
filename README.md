# CITE-30103 HW7
Q1. Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius with a toCelsius(float) function and prints the result to two decimals.

Q2. Reads three integers and returns the largest using comparisons only (no logical operators).

Q3. Checks if an integer is prime by testing divisors up to √n; prints “Prime” or “Not Prime.”

Q4. Swaps two integers via a pointer-based swap(int*,int*); shows values before and after.

Q5. Computes factorial recursively for non-negative n and prints n! (guards negative input).

Q6. Reads up to 100 integers, then prints their sum and average (floating-point).

Q7. Reads 10 integers and prints the minimum and maximum values.

Q8. Counts how many input integers are even vs. odd and prints both totals.

Q9. Reads 5 integers and reverses them in place (no second array), then prints the result.

Q10. Reads two 3×3 integer matrices and prints A, B, and their element-wise sum A+B.

Q11. Reads a line and computes its length manually (without strlen), then prints the length.

Q12. Reads a single word (no spaces) and prints “Palindrome” if it reads the same both ways (case-sensitive).

Q13. Reads a line (≤100 chars) and prints counts of vowels, consonants, and digits.

Q14. Reads two no-space strings and prints their manual concatenation (no strcat).

Q15. Reads a line (≤100 chars) and prints the number of words (words separated by one or more spaces).

Q16. Defines struct Student {name, roll, marks}, reads one record, and prints it neatly.

Q17. Reads 5 Student records into an array and prints all in a simple table (name, roll, marks).

Q18. From 5 Student records, finds and prints the topper’s name, roll, and marks.

Q19. Adds nested struct Date (DOB) inside Student, reads one record, and prints all fields including DOB.

Q20. Implements void printStudent(struct Student) and calls it from main to print one populated student.

Q21. Declares an int and a pointer to it; prints the variable’s value, its address with %p, and *p.

Q22. Inputs 5 integers and prints them using pointer arithmetic only (no [] indexing).

Q23. Uses malloc to read n integers, computes and prints their float average, then frees the memory.

Q24. Declares int square(int) and calls it through a function pointer; prints the squared result.
